# a futile experiment

this is me doing terrible things. don't attempt this unless under strict supervision.

## First naive attempt

Trying to include Services somehow from the app, but it's not a chrome privileged app so: fail.

## omni.ja

Trying the privileged-chrome way.

Failing, but I can't quite remember what it was exactly.

## socket.io attempt

Evidently fails with a CSP error

````bash
[JavaScript Error: "Content Security Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a resource at http://10.246.25.84:4000/socket.io/socket.io.js ("script-src app://system.gaiamobile.org")."]
`
